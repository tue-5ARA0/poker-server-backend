# Poker Server Backend Deployment

This repository contains the backend code for the Poker Bot Server, designed for the 5AR0 course.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. A Kubernetes cluster with an accessible control plane
2. `kubectl` installed and configured to interact with your cluster
3. A PostgreSQL database accessible through VPC in your Kubernetes cluster
4. Docker installed on your local machine
5. Access to a container registry (e.g., Scaleway Container Registry)

## Configure kubectl

Create a kube folder in your project and add your kubeconfig file from your cloud provider (e.g., Scaleway).
Set the KUBECONFIG environment variable:
```
export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-your-kube>/kubeconfig.yaml
```

## Verify your connection to the cluster

```
kubectl cluster-info
```

## Install Kubernetes Dashboard

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
```

## Create Namespace and ConfigMap

kubectl apply -f deploy/database_configmap_template.yaml
```
